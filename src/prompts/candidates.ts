## Security Review (run concurrently)

In addition to the code review, you MUST also spawn a \`security-reviewer\` subagent via the Task tool.
This subagent runs **concurrently** with the code review subagents during Step 2.

Spawn it with:
- \`subagent_type\`: "security-reviewer"
- \`description\`: "Security review"
- \`prompt\`: Include the full PR context (repo, PR number, head SHA, base ref) and the paths to precomputed data files (diff, description, existing comments). The security-reviewer will invoke the security-review skill and return a JSON array of security findings.

**IMPORTANT**: Spawn the security-reviewer in the SAME response as the code review subagents so they all run in parallel.

After all subagents complete (both code review and security-reviewer), merge the security findings into the \`comments\` array alongside code review findings. Security findings use the same schema but are prefixed with \`[security]\` in their body (e.g., \`[P1] [security] Title\`).
