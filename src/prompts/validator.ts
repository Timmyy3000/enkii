${passInstruction}

### Context

* Repo: ${repoFullName}
* PR Number: ${prNumber}
* PR Head Ref: ${prHeadRef}
* PR Head SHA: ${prHeadSha}
* PR Base Ref: ${prBaseRef}

### Inputs

Read these files before validating:
* PR Description: \`${descriptionPath}\`
* Candidates: \`${reviewCandidatesPath}\`
* Full PR Diff: \`${diffPath}\`
* Existing Comments: \`${commentsPath}\`

If the diff is large, read in chunks (offset/limit). **Do not proceed until you have read the ENTIRE diff.**

### Critical Requirements

1. You MUST read and validate **every** candidate before posting anything.
2. Preserve ordering: keep results in the same order as candidates.
3. **Posting rule (STRICT):** Only post comments where \`status === "approved"\`. Never post rejected items.

### Output: Write \`${reviewValidatedPath}\`

\`\`\`json
{
  "version": 1,
  "meta": {
    "repo": "${repoFullName}",
    "prNumber": ${prNumber},
    "headSha": "${prHeadSha}",
    "baseRef": "${prBaseRef}",
    "validatedAt": "<ISO timestamp>"
  },
  "results": [
    {
      "status": "approved",
      "comment": {
        "path": "src/index.ts",
        "body": "[P1] Title\\n\\n1 paragraph.",
        "line": 42,
        "startLine": null,
        "side": "RIGHT",
        "commit_id": "${prHeadSha}"

    }
  ],
  "reviewSummary": {
    "status": "approved",
    "body": "1-3 sentence overall assessment"
  }
}
\`\`\`

Notes:
* Use \`commit_id\` = \`${prHeadSha}\`.
* \`results\` MUST have exactly one entry per candidate, in the same order.

Tooling note:
* If the tools list includes \`ApplyPatch\` (common for OpenAI models like GPT-5.2), use \`ApplyPatch\` to create/update the file at the exact path.
* Otherwise, use \`Create\` (or \`Edit\` if overwriting) to write the file.

### Post approved items

After writing \`${reviewValidatedPath}\`, post comments ONLY for \`status === "approved"\`:

* (Phase 3 will wire posting. For Phase 1 the LLM only writes \`${reviewValidatedPath}\`. The action's non-LLM post step reads that file and submits a single batched review via octokit.)
* Do **NOT** include a \`body\` parameter in \`submit_review\`.
* Tracking comment update is handled by the action's post step, not by tool calls in the prompt.
* If any approved comments contain \`[security]\` in their body, prepend a security badge to the tracking comment: \`![Security Review](https://img.shields.io/badge/security%20review-ran-blue)\`. This indicates that security analysis was performed as part of the review.
* Do **NOT** post the summary as a separate comment or as the body of \`submit_review\`.
* Do not approve or request changes.
